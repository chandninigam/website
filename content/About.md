My name is Chandni Nigam, born in Lucknow. I have pursued my primary education (10+2) from <abbr title='Rani Laxmi Bai'>RLB</abbr> with computer science as my primary subject choice. After that, I went for bachelor's in computer science engineering from <abbr title='Babu Banarsi Das'>BBD:</abbr><abbr title="National Information Technology Management">NITM</abbr>.
While pursuing and studying engineering, I became passionate about web development, and started exploring different frontend technologies React, React Native, Next.js, Typescript etc.

After engineering, I've started working for <a href="https://jaxl.com/">Jaxl Innovation Private Limited</a>, where I started as an Intern and eventually transitioned into fulltime Software Engineer.

Other than the job, I have created some projects - Instagram clone (React Native), E-Commerce website (React.js) etc.
I like to read books, currently I'm reading Atomic Habits. Some of the books, which I've read includes Life is an amazing Secret, The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, and The Fault in our Star.
