My name is Chandni Nigam, born and brought up in Lucknow. I have pursued my primary education (10+2) from <abbr title='Rani Laxmi Bai'>RLB</abbr> with computer science as my primary subject choice. After that, I went for bachelor's in computer science engineering from <abbr title='Babu Banarsi Das'>BBD:</abbr><abbr title="National Information Technology Management">NITM</abbr>.
While pursuing and studying engineering, I became passionate about web development, and started exploring different frontend technologies React, React Native, Next.js, Typescript etc.

After engineering, I started my career at <a href="https://jaxl.com/">Jaxl Innovations Private Limited</a>, where I joined as an Intern and transitioned into a full-time Software Engineer, working on frontend development using Typescript and JavaScript.

I then joined <a href="https://www.okoders.com/">Okoders Technology</a> as a Software Engineer, where I focused on mobile application development using React Native, building cross-platform apps with smooth user experiences and clean architecture.

After that, I worked at Mobile Programming India Pvt. Ltd. on the <a href="https://www.adanione.com/">Adanione </a> project as a Frontend Developer, contributing to scalable UI development using React, Next.js, and TypeScript.

Other than the job, I have created some projects - Instagram clone (React Native), E-Commerce website (React.js) etc.
