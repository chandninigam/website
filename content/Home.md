My name is Chandni Nigam, I am born and brought up in Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh. I have done bachelors in Computer Science Engineering from BBD: NITM. I am passionate about frontend engineering (web and mobile) and I work with different technologies including HTML, CSS/SCSS, Javascript/Typescript, React/React Native/Next. I have worked at <a href="https://jaxl.com/" >Jaxl Innovation Private Limited </a> in the past.
