My name is Chandni Nigam, I am born and brought up in Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh. I have done bachelors in Computer Science Engineering from BBD: NITM. I am passionate about frontend engineering (web and mobile) and I work with different technologies including HTML, CSS/SCSS, Javascript/Typescript, React/React Native/Next. I’ve worked as a frontend developer across three companies— <a href="https://www.adanione.com/">Adani One</a>, <a href="https://www.okoders.com/">Okoders Technology </a>, and <a href="https://jaxl.com/" >Jaxl Innovations Private Limited </a> as a Software Engineer, where I contributed to building responsive and scalable web applications.

In my free time, I like to read books, currently I'm reading <a href="https://www.blackriverpublicschool.org/userfiles/53/Classes/1461/learn%20to%20earn%20by%20peter%20lynch,%20john%20rothchild%20(1).pdf?id=2549">Learn to Earn </a>. I also like cooking.
